# Deploying an OPNsense NGFW in Virtual Box
![Cloud Honeynet / SOC](https://github.com/EdgarAcuna8/Azure-SOC/assets/146898815/4349ce5a-a5b5-4bdb-a22e-1e057599039a)

## Introduction

In this project, I deployed an OPNsense firewall on a virtualized environment using Virtual Box. I created a Windows and Kali Linux client connected to the firewall to test out various features. 

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)
